RESTful API Readme
This document provides a brief overview of the RESTful API developed for the Contact me.

Overview
The RESTful API provides a way for clients to interact with the Contact me system. It follows the principles of REST and allows clients to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.

The API is built using JavaScript/Express.js, Node.js, mongoose, mongoDB. It uses [database technology] for data storage.

Authentication
The API requires authentication for certain endpoints. Clients must obtain an API key by registering an account on the Martin-Stojmenovski-portfolio-website. The API key must be included in the Authorization header of each request.

Endpoints
The API provides the following endpoints:

[Resource]
GET /resource - Get a list of all resources.
POST /resource - Create a new resource.
GET /resource/:id - Get a specific resource.
PUT /resource/:id - Update a specific resource.
DELETE /resource/:id - Delete a specific resource.
[Other Resource]
GET /other_resource - Get a list of all other resources.
POST /other_resource - Create a new other resource.
GET /other_resource/:id - Get a specific other resource.
PUT /other_resource/:id - Update a specific other resource.
DELETE /other_resource/:id - Delete a specific other resource.
Responses
The API returns JSON responses for all requests. Successful requests return a status code of 200 OK. If a request fails, the API returns an appropriate error status code along with a JSON error message.

Error Codes
The API uses the following error codes:

400 Bad Request - The request is malformed or missing required parameters.
401 Unauthorized - Authentication failed or the client is not authorized to access the resource.
404 Not Found - The requested resource was not found.
500 Internal Server Error - An unexpected error occurred on the server.
Rate Limiting
The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. Clients are limited to [limit] requests per [time period]. If a client exceeds the limit, the API returns a 429 Too Many Requests error.

Conclusion
The RESTful API provides a convenient way for clients to interact with the [Project Name] system. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, while also providing advanced features such as authentication and rate limiting.
